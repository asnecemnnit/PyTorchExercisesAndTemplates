  <p align="left">Exercises and templates for programming in Software 2.0. Goal of this repository is to:<br />
  1. Add minimal code for basic deep-learning/computer-vision functionalities, which could be directly used in various projects.<br />
  2. Have modularised code (Classes, Objects, different files for different functionalities).<br />
  3. Have better understanding of OpenCV, PyTorch and other deep-learning/computer-vision frameworks.<br />
  4. Be in constant touch with Software 2.0 programming.<br />
  For more information on Software 2.0, refer to this blogpost by https://github.com/karpathy on https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35
